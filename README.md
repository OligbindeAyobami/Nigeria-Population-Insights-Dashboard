# Recommendations
#Economic Development in High-Growth Areas
 States like Abuja, Gombe, and Nasarawa, which have seen rapid population growth, should receive targeted economic development programs. Infrastructure, education, healthcare, and employment opportunities must be expanded to accommodate this growth and prevent urban overcrowding and resource strain.
 
# Policy Focus on Low-Growth Regions
 Osun, Oyo, and Kaduna, with the lowest growth rates, may need tailored interventions to address their slower population growth. Economic incentives and policies that promote local industry development, urban renewal, and migration incentives could help stimulate growth and development in these states.
 
# Population Management in High-Density Zones
 The Northwest and Southwest, being the most populous regions, require strategic population management plans to avoid overpopulation issues. These could include family planning programs, improving access to education and healthcare, and ensuring sustainable agricultural and urban planning to manage resources effectively.
